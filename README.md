# SIMPL: Simple IMperative Programming Language

SIMPL is a imperative programming language. It supports features like variables, numerical and boolean operations, mutation, condition statements, and loops. There is also an extended version of SIMPL called SIMPL-F (SIMPL with Functions) that additionally supports functions (including recursion). SIMPL and SIMPL-F are compiled to the assembly language A-PRIMPL (Assembly PRimitive IMperative Programming Language). Funally, A-PRIMPL is assembled into the machine language PRIMPL (PRimitive IMperative Programming Language). There is a program that executes PRIMPL, simulating how a CPU would run the machine language. 

This project includes the following: SIMPL compiler, SIMPL-F compiler, assembler, and a program that runs PRIMPL. 

More description about SIMPL, SIMPL-F, A-PRIMPL, and PRIMPL (for ex, syntax) coming soon...
